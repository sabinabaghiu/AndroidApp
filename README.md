# AndroidApp

This application is called PlannerZen and the purpose is to help people be more organized and motivated. In the app, you will be able to create to-do lists, in order to keep track
of daily activities. Moreover, you can see statistics of your tasks, as well as your progress. The app will also send reminders, so that you can achieve your goal and keep you 
motivated. I chose to do this app because I always tried to plan my activities and failed. I am sure I am not the only one with this struggle, so this application can come in hand
and help improve this aspect.
